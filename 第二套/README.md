      B: The goal of Value Stream Map is to optimize the flow of information or materials required to complete a process, thereby reducing the time it takes to create value and eliminating wasteful or unnecessary work. In value stream mapping, we create a visual map of a process flow, so that we can identify where delays, waste, and constraints are occurring. Once we identify the areas that could be improved in the process, we can then look for ways to remove those problems and make the process more efficient

      D: According to Mike Griffiths, PMI-ACP Exam Prep, 1st Ed, Spikes are a key tool that agile teams use to head off problems and resolve them as early as possible. A spike is a short effort (usually timeboxed) that is devoted to exploring an approach, investigating an issue, or reducing a project risk. Although spikes can be done at any time during a project, they often take the form of brief exploratory iterations or proof-of-concept efforts that are done at the start of a project, before the development effort begins.

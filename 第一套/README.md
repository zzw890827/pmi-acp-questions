      - When more than a few weeks have passed since the previous retrospective.

       A: I thingk A is the better option. This reference is from Scalade. That could kill the transformation before it even gets started, and before the teams have had a chance to prove the value of the role. Therefore, SAFe takes a pragmatic approach and assumes, in general, that the Scrum Master is a part-time role. During initial SAFe adoption, however, the job may be more intensive. At this stage, the organization may find it beneficial to bring external consultants on board to coach the teams while they become experienced in Scrum and SAFe. These outside consultant Scrum Masters will often coach multiple teams in the organization
